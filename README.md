```


## ‚ú® Features

- **GitOps with Flux**: Automated deployment and management of cluster resources via [Flux](https://fluxcd.io/).
- **Scalability**: Designed for both small home-lab clusters and large-scale production setups.
- **Customizable App Deployments**: Applications are primarily managed using the [bjw-s App Template](https://bjw-s.github.io/helm-charts/docs/app-template/), allowing tailored configurations for specific needs.
- **Secrets Management**: Integration with `sops` and `age` for secure secret management.
- **CNI and Networking**: Uses [Cilium](https://cilium.io/) for advanced networking and security.
- **Ingress Management**: Includes [ingress-nginx](https://www.f5.com/products/nginx/nginx-ingress-controller) for internal and external access to applications.
- **Monitoring and Observability**: Pre-configured monitoring stack ([Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/), [Grafana](https://grafana.com/)).
- **Storage**:
  - [Longhorn](https://longhorn.io): Distributed block storage for Kubernetes.
  - [MinIO](https://min.io): S3-compatible object storage.
  - [NFS Subdir External Provisioner](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/nfs-subdir-external-provisioner): Lightweight NFS-based storage provisioner.
  - [OpenEBS](https://openebs.io): Cloud-native storage for containers.


## üì¶ Applications

The cluster hosts the following applications:

- **[Automad](https://automad.org/)**: A flat-file content management system.
- **[Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/)**: A self-hosted home automation platform.
- **[Immich](https://immich.app/)**: Photo and video backup service with AI-based search capabilities.
- **[Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/)**: A decentralized social network instance.
- **[Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/)**: A self-hosted productivity platform.
- **[Paperless-ngx](https://docs.paperless-ngx.com/)**: Document management system for organizing and digitizing your paperwork.

All these applications are deployed using the **[bjw-s App Template](https://bjw-s.github.io/helm-charts/docs/app-template/)**, which provides a flexible and modular approach to application management. This ensures that each application is tailored to meet my personal requirements.


## üîí Security

- **Namespace `Security`**: A dedicated namespace for managing security-related services.
  - **Identity Provider**: [Authentik](https://goauthentik.io/) is deployed to provide centralized authentication and SSO capabilities.
  - **Secrets Management**: [external-secrets](https://external-secrets.io/latest/) integrates with [1Password](https://1password.com/) for secure, automated secrets management.
- **TLS Everywhere**: All applications are configured to use TLS, managed by `cert-manager` with Let's Encrypt, ensuring end-to-end encryption.
- **BSI Compliance**: TLS certificates are configured to meet the BSI's Technical Guideline [TR-02102-2](https://www.bsi.bund.de/DE/Themen/Unternehmen-und-Organisationen/Standards-und-Zertifizierung/Technische-Richtlinien/TR-nach-Thema-sortiert/tr02102/tr-02102.html) standards.
- **ECDSA Certificates**: Preferred for stronger cryptography and improved performance.
- **Secrets Encryption**: Managed using `sops` and `age` to ensure secure storage and transmission of sensitive information.


## üèóÔ∏è Cluster Infrastructure

The cluster is built on high-performance virtual root servers provided by [Netcup](https://www.netcup.com/de/?ref=97728). Below are the details of the infrastructure:

- **Cluster Nodes**:
  - Three virtual root servers (RS 2000 G11) with the following specifications:
    - **CPU**: 8 cores
    - **Memory**: 16 GB RAM
    - **Storage**: 512 GB SSD
  - All servers run **[Talos OS](https://www.talos.dev/)**, optimized for containerized workloads.
- **Firewall**:
  - A dedicated **[OPNsense](https://opnsense.org/)** firewall deployed on a separate virtual server, also hosted at Netcup.
  - The firewall handles connections to local home networks and provides secure ingress/egress traffic control.
- **NFS Server**:
  - A separate virtual server at Netcup is used to provide NFS storage, enabling robust persistence for cluster applications.

## üåü Acknowledgments

This cluster setup is inspired by and based on the exceptional [cluster-template](https://github.com/onedr0p/cluster-template) by **onedr0p**.

The template serves as a comprehensive foundation for GitOps-driven Kubernetes cluster management. It provides:
- **Best Practices**: Following modern standards in Kubernetes infrastructure.
- **Flexibility**: A highly modular and customizable design.
- **Community Support**: Extensive documentation and a supportive community.

Additionally, the cluster heavily relies on the excellent [Helm Charts](https://github.com/bjw-s/helm-charts) provided by **bjw-s**. The **AppTemplate** offered by bjw-s makes application management streamlined and highly customizable, allowing for tailored deployments that fit unique needs while maintaining consistency and reliability.

Special thanks to **onedr0p** and **bjw-s** for sharing these fantastic resources, which significantly enhanced the quality and efficiency of this cluster's setup!
